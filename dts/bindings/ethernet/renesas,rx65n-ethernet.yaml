  stored_mac_address:
    type: int
    required: false
    description:
      A MAC address can be stored, usually in the RX65N data flash, and read
      from this address at startup. For verification, the 6 bytes starting at
      this address have to be repeated once and followed by a uin16_t value
      which is the sum of all bytes. The data is also ignored if it is all 0x00.

      If set and the flash contains a valid MAC address, local-mac-address and
      zephyr,random-mac-address fields are ignored.
